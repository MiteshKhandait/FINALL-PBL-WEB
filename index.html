            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> <br>As it has been apparent for the past several years online education has emerged as a powerful<br>contender for the next new education technology. 
                    Although the previous technological<br>breakthroughsthat have failed to live
                    up to their initial promise, I strongly believe this time really is<br> different.<br>
                    -Objective of the Study:<br>
                    1) To understand the concept of online education.<br>
                    2) To study current state and future of online education in India.<br>
                    -How is online learning changing education?<br>
                    Online education gives students an opportunity to plan their future course of action and fast track their careers .Through live and interactive digital learning, edutech firms are imparting comprehensive and specialized knowledge which will enable children and adults to learn with a purpose and instil a sense of belief in them. Such offerings are changing the way India learns by giving students an edge in learning, along with an opportunity to progress in their career<br>
                    <br>-Social media as a learning tool:<br>
                    • Social media as a tool can be used to enhance elearning experience and make it more engaging, relevant and culturally diverse.<br>
                    • Students can critique and share feedback on each other's assignments, work in collaboration to create content that can be easily accessed.<br>
                    -CHALLENGES<br>
                    1. Lack of Infrastructure and hardware facilities which hamper reliability of online learning.<br>
                    2. Problem in finding willing skilled manpower to training illiterate rural areas of India.<br>
                    3. No or very less computer based courses/skills taught to students in government primary schools to increase their knowledge about ICT importance in rural development.<br><br>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19 has rapidly and dramatically altered our lives. Unfortunately, teenagers and young adults are among those who may be most impacted as a result of the virus.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring and summer months of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic drove many schools to cancel in-person classes and graduation ceremonies.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the safety of students and teachers is of the utmost importance, online learning can have an impact on the mental health of teens. We explain how online learning impacts teen mental health, along with ways parents can help their teens cope while learning remotely.<br><br>
